On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. The invasion caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II,[16][17] with more than 8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country[18] and a third of the population displaced.[19][20] The invasion also caused global food shortages.
